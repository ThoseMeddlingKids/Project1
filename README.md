# Project1
Designing a scheduling client that allows users to create events and designate times available for said events.

To get started with our project you'll need to download donejs to your home directory:

`npm install -g donejs`

You'll then need to `cd` into `Plan-EZ` directory. Once in the directory, you'll need to download the dependencies using:

`npm install`

This might take awhile so be patient.

In order to run the project, you'll need to run this while in the `Plan-EZ` directory:

`donejs develop`

This will create the project on a localhost and you'll be able to view the webpage by going to the link that your terminal gives.

Two different modes exist:

1. <b>System Admin Mode</b> allows users to create new calendar events by selecting a date for the event and a set of times that they are available.

2. <b>Adjust Availability Mode</b> allows users to see a list of previously created events and add a set of times that they are available for that event.

We currently plan to use JavaScript to complete this project.
