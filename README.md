# Project1
Designing a scheduling client that allows users to create events and designate times available for said events.

Two different modes exist:

1. <b>System Admin Mode</b> allows users to create new calendar events by selecting a date for the event and a set of times that they are available.

2. <b>Adjust Availability Mode</b> allows users to see a list of previously created events and add a set of times that they are available for that event.

We currently plan to use JavaScript to complete this project.
